ðŸ§  SQL Analysis Highlights
ðŸŽ¯ 1) **Predicting High-Value Deals Using Revenue Percentile Analysis **
- classifies deals into high, mid, and low-value segments and identifies which sales agents 
close the most high-value deals.

  ** Query Solutions -**
  
  WITH CleanedDates AS (
    SELECT 
        sp.account,
        a.sector,
        TRY_CAST(sp.engage_date AS DATE) AS engage_dt,
        TRY_CAST(sp.close_date AS DATE) AS close_dt
    FROM sales_pipeline sp
    JOIN accounts a ON sp.account = a.account
    WHERE sp.engage_date IS NOT NULL AND sp.close_date IS NOT NULL
),
Durations AS (
    SELECT 
        sector,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, engage_dt, close_dt) AS duration_days
    FROM CleanedDates
    WHERE engage_dt IS NOT NULL AND close_dt IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    sector,
    COUNT(*) AS deal_count,
    AVG(duration_days) AS avg_days_to_close,
    MAX(duration_days) AS max_days,
    MIN(duration_days) AS min_days
FROM Durations
GROUP BY sector
ORDER BY avg_days_to_close DESC;


2) ** Sales Pipeline Velocity Analysis**
 - identify which accounts are moving faster or slower through different deal stages and can 
highlight bottlenecks.

**Query Solutions -**

WITH CleanedDates AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        deal_stage,
        TRY_CAST(engage_date AS DATE) AS engage_dt,
        TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE) AS close_dt
    FROM sales_pipeline
    WHERE engage_date IS NOT NULL AND close_date IS NOT NULL
),
Durations AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        deal_stage,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, engage_dt, close_dt) AS duration_days
    FROM CleanedDates
    WHERE engage_dt IS NOT NULL AND close_dt IS NOT NULL
),
Deal_StageWiseVelocity AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        deal_stage,
        COUNT(*) AS deal_count,
        AVG(duration_days) AS avg_days_to_close,
        MAX(duration_days) AS long_duration_days,
		MIN(duration_days) AS short_duration_days

    FROM Durations
    GROUP BY account, deal_stage
)
SELECT *
FROM Deal_StageWiseVelocity
ORDER BY avg_days_to_close DESC;

3) **Average Deal Closing Time by Industry**
-  Calculate the average number of days taken to close a deal for each industry.

  **Query Solution -**

  WITH CleanedDates AS (
    SELECT 
        sp.account,
        a.sector,
        TRY_CAST(sp.engage_date AS DATE) AS engage_dt,
        TRY_CAST(sp.close_date AS DATE) AS close_dt
    FROM sales_pipeline sp
    JOIN accounts a ON sp.account = a.account
    WHERE sp.engage_date IS NOT NULL AND sp.close_date IS NOT NULL
),
Durations AS (
    SELECT 
        sector,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, engage_dt, close_dt) AS duration_days
    FROM CleanedDates
    WHERE engage_dt IS NOT NULL AND close_dt IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    sector,
    COUNT(*) AS deal_count,
    AVG(duration_days) AS avg_days_to_close,
    MAX(duration_days) AS max_days,
    MIN(duration_days) AS min_days
FROM Durations
GROUP BY sector
ORDER BY avg_days_to_close DESC;

4)  **Churn Risk Analysis Based on Deal Loss Patterns**
 - This query identifies accounts with a high risk of churn by calculating the lost deal 
percentage and the time gap since their last won deal.

**Query Solutions **
-- Step 1: Count total, lost, and won deals for each account
WITH DealCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        COUNT(*) AS total_deals,
        SUM(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Lost' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS lost_deals,
        SUM(CASE WHEN deal_stage = 'Won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS won_deals
    FROM sales_pipeline
    GROUP BY account
),

-- Step 2: Calculate percentage of deals that were lost
LostDealPercentage AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        (CAST(lost_deals AS FLOAT) / total_deals) * 100 AS lost_deal_percentage
    FROM DealCounts
),

-- Step 3: Get the most recent 'Won' deal date for each account
LastWonDealDate AS (
    SELECT 
        account,
        MAX(TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE)) AS last_won_date
    FROM sales_pipeline
    WHERE deal_stage = 'Won'
    GROUP BY account
),

-- Step 4: Combine data and calculate days since last 'Won' deal
ChurnRisk AS (
    SELECT 
        ldp.account,
        ldp.lost_deal_percentage,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, lwd.last_won_date, GETDATE()) AS Time_gap_since_last_won
    FROM LostDealPercentage ldp
    LEFT JOIN LastWonDealDate lwd 
        ON ldp.account = lwd.account
)

-- Step 5: Final output sorted by risk
SELECT 
    account,
    lost_deal_percentage,
    Time_gap_since_last_won
FROM ChurnRisk
ORDER BY 
    lost_deal_percentage DESC, 
    Time_gap_since_last_won DESC;
    
5) ** Sales Seasonality & Revenue Impact Analysis**
 - This query identifies seasonal trends in sales performance by analyzing revenue fluctuations 
across months and years.

**Query Solutions**

-- Step 1: Convert close_date into Year and Month
WITH MonthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT 
        DATEPART(YEAR, TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE)) AS year,
        DATEPART(MONTH, TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE)) AS month,
        SUM(close_value) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales_pipeline
    WHERE deal_stage = 'Won'
    GROUP BY 
        DATEPART(YEAR, TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE)),
        DATEPART(MONTH, TRY_CAST(close_date AS DATE))
)

-- Step 2: View revenue trends by year and month
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    total_revenue
FROM MonthlyRevenue
ORDER BY year, month;
